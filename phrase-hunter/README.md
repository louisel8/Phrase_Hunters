 my third techdegree project - phrase hunter game

 - it's a phrase guessing game. The user can guess one letter each time;
 - if the letter is in the phrase, the programm shows the letter from the phrase;
 - other space keeps empty until the user guessed;
 - the user gets 5 chances for missed guesses;
 - when the user reaches 5 times and has not guessed the right phrase, the user gets an option to guess more rounds or quit;
 - when the user repeatedly entered the letter, the programm will remind the user that the letter has been guessed before;
 - when user guessed the wrong letter, the wrong letter/s will be shown to the user as a hint that which ones are not in the phrase;


Keep learning and keep pushing forward!
